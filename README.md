# Project Overview
This project automates the process of entering data from an Excel spreadsheet into a web application using UiPath. The bot reads data from two Excel sheets ("Projects" and "Clients") and inputs the respective values into corresponding forms on the target web application. The project implements validation techniques to ensure that the data is accurately inputted into the web application. Additionally, the project includes Git integration for source control and version management, allowing multiple collaborators to work on the project effectively.

# Features
Automated Data Entry: Reads data from Excel sheets and enters them into a web-based form.
Data Validation and Logging: Ensures accurate input of data and logs errors for debugging.
Source Control Integration: Full Git integration for tracking changes, managing versions, and collaborating with others.
Error Handling: Catches and logs exceptions that occur during data processing and web automation.
Technologies and Tools Used
UiPath Studio: Automation software for building and running RPA workflows.
Microsoft Excel: Source of data for the bot.
Git: Version control for managing project changes.
GitHub: Remote repository hosting for collaboration.
Web Browser: The automation interacts with the web application using standard browser automation.
